Exercises

1. Allow underscores in the calculator’s variable names.

2. Provide an assignment operator, =, so that you can change the value of a variable after you introduce it using let. Discuss why that can be useful and how it can be a source of problems.

3. Provide named constants that you really can’t change the value of. Hint: You have to add a member to Variable that distinguishes between constants and variables and check for it in set_value(). If you want to let the user define constants (rather than just having pi and e defined as constants), you’ll have to add a notation to let the user express that, for example, const pi = 3.14;.
